## Laravel E-commerce Website
__This is a simple e-commerce website built with Laravel framework__ 

> __Features__
- Users can view each product and give reviews about them.
- Users need to be logged in to give review.
- A rating(random number between 1-5) will be generated for each review (see below to know why). The average of all ratings for a particular product will be used to generate overall rating for that product.

> __Limitations__
- Logging out results in loss of items in the cart

> __Why Random Rating?__

Initially, this project was supposed to be an AI based project for __Product Rating Using Sentiment Analysis__ of the reviews written by the users. But since I couldn't integrate the __AI__(sentiment analysis) part that was written in Python into this PHP(Laravel) based website, this project became just a simple e-commerce website.<br>

> The __Product Rating Using Sentiment Analysis__ project was seperately done using Python's __Flask__ micro web framework. <a href="https://github.com/xitish/Product-Rating"> See the project </a>
